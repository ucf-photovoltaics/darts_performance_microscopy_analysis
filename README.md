# UCF DARTS Project 06 - Analysis of PV Cell Performance Data and Microscopy Images
This project is combining analysis of PV cell electrical data with SEM image annotations to consider how time and condition work to degrade the performance of different PV cell architectures.

# About the Project
The Python scripts allow for the generation of graphs in matplotlib and seaborn. Data manipulation in pandas allows for the selection, filtration, and organization of data.

# About the Data
The data was provided by the Small Innovative Projects in Solar (SIPS) program at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU). This project was initially undertaken for the Data-Enabled Research Training and Development Sprints (DARTS), presented by the Florida Solar Energy Center (FSEC) and the Resilient, Intelligent, and Sustainable Energy Systems (RISES) lab at the University of Central Florida (UCF).
